---------------

There are two ways to use requirements-txt command line tool. The first one is:

.. code-block::

    requirements-txt <command> <options>

The second one is to use alias:

.. code-block::

    rt <command> <options>

Both commands results in the same outcome. It's just an alias.

.bashrc, .zshrc or other .*rc file:

.. code-block::

    alias rt=". rt"
    alias requirements-txt=". requirements-txt"

It will allow requirements-txt cli to activate your environment and init command.
You can also achieve this by the command:
